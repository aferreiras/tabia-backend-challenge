# backend-challenge

Hello, developer :wave:!

Welcome to the Tabia backend challenge.

> **_NOTE:_** This challenge is part of the hiring process. We assume here that you are already in contact with someone at Tabia. If that is not the case, please apply at careers.tabia.health.

## Instructions

In this challenge, we expect you to:

- Implement the provided interfaces, considering:
  - All the data should be stored in memory, inside the application context (no external database is needed)
  - Support concurrent accesses, both for read and write
  - Use data structures that optimize either the read or write operations (and justify your choices)
- Write all code and documentation in english

Some other desired requirements are:

- Write unit tests;
- Justify design choices, arguing about costs and benefits involved. You may write those as comments inline or, if you wish, provide a separate document summarizing those choices;

> If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

## Solve the challenge

There is no unique solution to this challenge. The main intent is to evaluate candidate's ability and familiarity with tools and best practices.
